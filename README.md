# Learn-Solidity

I have built a Static web app for learning Solidity.
I used HTML, Css and AZURE STATIC WEB APP, AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS.
Any one can learn the solidity which is one of the most important and needed part for web3..
Web3 is a leading technology.
So any person can come to our website for getting resources. We update our website once in a 15 days and add new resources .

I used Azure static web app for hosting my website and azure storage accounts for storing the source code
